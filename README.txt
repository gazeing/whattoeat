People who are in charge of cooking of one family, like my mom, always wonder that "what we are going to eat today?". This thinking becomes annoying when you have to think it every day, not mention to think about the material used in cooking. This issue also happens between young couples who are arguing everything. This app is supposed to help these people out of the nightmare of choosing.

Originally, you can add recipes in it (next verion maybe can search the web and recommand for you), then you can add dishes to you dinner or have a random choice made by system. The material required will be shown in a shopping list automatically.
